## Report on the UFO analysis

### Analysis
There were a lot of UFO's sights across North America in 2010. Using JavaScript, I was successful in building a web UI (user interface) that would allow users to filter through unidentified flying object sightings data. 

### Results
Users could filter results by date, city, state, country and shape of objects. The webpage filters the results dynamically as users provide information in the search fields; as the user navigates to the next field, the page updates the results.

### Search Criteria
This example shows a user entering nc for North Carolina in state field.

### Search Results

### Summary
JavaScript functions allow for the client interface to load, filter and respond dynamically based on users input, therefore the response time is fairly quick. Other than redesigning the webpage to provide a more condensed layout, I don't have any other recommendations for further development. 

JavaScript is far more involved then I have ever had to pleasure to use thus far. Becoming proficient in JavaScript requires a lot of practice and patience.
